For example, we may use analytics cookies to see which pages are visited most often, to identify and resolve errors, and to understand where our visitors are coming from.</li>
          <li className="mb-2"><strong>Functionality Cookies:</strong> These cookies allow our Site to remember choices you make (such as your language preference) and provide enhanced, more personal features. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for, such as watching a video or commenting on a blog.</li>
          <li className="mb-2"><strong>Marketing and Advertising Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to track visitors across websites. The intention is to display ads that are relevant and engaging for the individual user and thereby more valuable for publishers and third-party advertisers. We may also use these cookies to help us deliver targeted advertising and measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>

        <p className="mb-4">You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences in the following ways:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li className="mb-2"><strong>Browser Controls:</strong> You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Site though your access to some functionality and areas of our Site may be restricted.

          <li className="mb-2"><strong>Specific Cookie Opt-Outs:</strong> For certain third-party cookies, you may be able to go directly to the third party&apos;s website to opt-out of their use of cookies. For example, many advertising providers offer opt-out mechanisms.</li>
          <li className="mb-2"><strong>Our Cookie Banner:</strong> When you first visit our Site, we may display a cookie banner that allows you to manage your cookie preferences. You can usually revisit and change your settings at any time through a link on our Site (if implemented).</li>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Other Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">We may also use other tracking technologies similar to cookies, such as web beacons (also known as pixel tags or clear gifs). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Site or opened an email that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Site to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve site performance.</p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">6. Changes to This Cookie Policy</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
